# APC tree

In order to be able to edit the APC tree we need to select a draft tree from the **select draft** drop-down in the top menu (it will actually say **No draft selected** in the menu if you haven't selected a draft tree yet).

We select the 'APC Daily minor edits' tree, which is a draft tree that is always there. When no edits have been made yet, it is an exact copy of the APC tree.

## Place an instance on the tree

To place in instance on the tree, select the instance and open the **Tree** tab.

The only information you have to fill in is the **Parent**. For instances of names of generic and lower ranks this will already be filled in. Note that for genera it is not necessarily filled in correctly.

::: warning Note
In AusMoss, we don't use the APC distribution. Instead we add the distribution as instance notes.

Once you have made sure the information is correct, you can click **Place**. A message will appear at the bottom saying that the instance has been placed.

When you refresh the page, you can see that the instance now has the <span style="color:brown">APC Daily minor edits</span> tick. Once the draft tree is published this will become an <span style="color:red">APC</span> tick.

## Remove an instance from the tree

To remove an instance from the tree, select the instance and open the **Tree** tab. The **Remove** button is all the way at the bottom.

You will be asked to **Confirm** or **Cancel**. Assuming you indeed want to remove the instance, click **Confirm remove**.

You'll get a message telling you what just happened. It is in green, so it must be okay. The waste bucket in the **Confirm remove** button will keep spinning until you click **Refresh** or refresh the page.

When you have refreshed the page, you'll see that the <span style="color:brown">APC Daily minor edits</span> tick has disappeared and only the <span style="color:red">APC</span> tick is left. When the draft tree is published that will have gone as well.

## Publish the draft tree

In order to publish the draft tree, click on the **APC Daily minor edits** item in the top menu and then "Publish 'Daily minor edits'".

There are probably a few more steps to go through, but I am not ready to publish my draft tree yet, so I will finish this later.
